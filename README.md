# Second-Hand-shop

Imagine you are a student who just whent to university and are now deeper in dept than someone from skuldf√§llan. Imagine that you are a new studend who wants to go to university, but sees the other student in what can only me stadet as economic hell. Whell wory no more, for second academia is here to help with this new website!

# Purpouse

In the website there are 2 kinds of people: Clients(those who graduated university) and Customers(those who just entered). These students are, at an increasing rate even ,usualy broke collage kids who can't afford to be slaves to debt. The purpouse of the website is therefore to provide a platform where Clients can publish studdy material to get some money back, and for customers to purchase study material att cheep prices. The main demographic will be sweden as this product is developed by a swedish developer, but may expand to collages in the EU, Canada and the USA. Especialy the USA since student dept is more cripeling there than an emos depression.

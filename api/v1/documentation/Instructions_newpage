section at the botom and use javascript to make them vicible?
maby...
I will probably have to start using javascript soon with the carousell.
That will mean i will have to do another structural change, but i may get better results.
Because now, the cart is in the nav and the nav expands with it. I need cart to expand
independently of nav
